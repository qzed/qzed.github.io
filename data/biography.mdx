# Biography

Hi, I'm Maximilian.

I'm interested in Computer Vision, Robotics and Machine Learning in general, working as a PhD student at the <a href="https://rl.uni-freiburg.de">Robot Learning Lab of the University of Freiburg</a>.

In my spare time, I'm a Linux Kernel maintainer for Microsoft Surface devices.
Presently, I'm trying to make the ARM-based Surface Pro X and its Qualcomm SoC play nice with Linux.
