# About Me

Hi, I'm Maximilian.

I'm interested in Computer Vision, Robotics and Machine Learning in general.
At the moment, I'm working as a research assistant at the [Computer Vision Group of the University of Stuttgart][cv-us] under the direction of Professor Andr√©s Bruhn, focussing on robust Optical Flow estimation.

In my spare time, I'm a Linux Kernel maintainer for Microsoft Surface devices.
Presently, I'm trying to make the ARM-based Surface Pro X and its Qualcomm SoC play nice with Linux.
