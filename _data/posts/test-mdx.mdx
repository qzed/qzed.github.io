import Image from 'next/image';

{/* this is a comment */}

{/*
    this is a multiline comment
    test
*/}

This is an image via `next.js/image`:

<Image src="/assets/profile.png" width='100px' height='100px'/>


Write comments:
```jsx
{/* This is a comment. */}

{/*
    This is a multi-line comment.
*/}
```
