## About Me

Hi, I'm Maximilian.

I just finished my Master's Thesis in Computer Science at the University of Stuttgart, Germany.
I'm interested in Computer Vision and Robotics and currently looking for a PhD position.
Meanwhile, I'm working as a research assistant at the [Computer Vision Group of the University of Stuttgart](https://www.vis.uni-stuttgart.de/en/institute/research_group/computer_vision/) under the direction of Professor Andr√©s Bruhn, focussing on robust Optical Flow estimation.

In my spare time, I'm a Linux Kernel maintainer for Microsoft Surface devices.
Presently, I'm trying to make the ARM-based Surface Pro X and its Qualcomm SoC play nice with Linux.
